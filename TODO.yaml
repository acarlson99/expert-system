TODO:
  - Multiple evaluation:
      A => B
      ?B
      This evaluated A twice
  - Add ability to remove rules
  - Be able to read from files
  - Possible logic bug:
```
    A=>C+D
    =A
    65

    ?A
    65
    [true]

    ?C
    67
    [true]

    C=>Z
    ?Z
    90
    [false]
    
    ?C
    67
    [true]
```
    - Logic seems to be broken, check test cases
