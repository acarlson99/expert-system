TODO:
  - Add ability to remove rules
  - Graph visualization
  - Reset rules, etc.

DONE:
  - Multiple evaluation:
      A => B
      ?B
      This evaluated A twice
  - Possible logic bug:
      A=>C+D
      =A
      ?A
      [true]
      ?C
      [true]
      C=>Z
      ?Z
      [false]
      ?C
      [true]
  - Test cases seem to broken, check logic
  - Logic seems to be broken, check test cases
