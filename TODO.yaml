TODO:
  - Multiple evaluation:
      A => B
      ?B
      This evaluated A twice
  - Recursive definitions:
      A => A smashes that stack
  - Add ability to remove rules
  - Make whitespace insignificant in parser
  - ((C | A) | ((A & (C & (D & (E & F)))) | (D | (C | A)))) => B breaks parser somehow
